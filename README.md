# Yet another model build system.

This is a very basic and simple model build system for android applications.

# Usage:

Have python installed. You would also need sh and toposort libraries. You can get them from pip. Hor init.sh you will need shell and sed installed.

 * Set ANDROID\_HOME and JAVA\_HOME environmental variables.
 * Make a directory for your new project. `cd` into it.
 * Call init.sh from kbuild folder.
 * Run ./build.py install

These scripts have been checked on linux, but should run on other OS'es too.
